		<b>Antimagic Field: (8th-Level Abjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Self (10-foot radius sphere)<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour<br><br>
		A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that 
		suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items 
		become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">Spells and other magical effects, except those 
		created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast 
		a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed
		counts against its duration.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Targeted Effects.</b> Spells 
		and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere 
		have no effect on that target.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Areas of Magic.</b> The area of another spell or 
		magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of 
		the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are 
		suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Spells.</b> Any active spell or other magical 
		effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Magic Items.</b> The properties and powers of 
		magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical 
		longsword.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">A magic weapon's properties and powers are 
		suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon 
		or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear
		at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Magical Travel.</b> Teleportation and planar 
		travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical 
		travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional 
		space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Creatures and Objects.</b> A creature or object 
		summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears 
		once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>Dispel Magic.</b> Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic 
		have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each
		other.</p>
