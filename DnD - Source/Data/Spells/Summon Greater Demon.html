		<b>Summon Greater Demon: (4th-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a vial of blood from a humanoid killed within the past 24 hours.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour<br><br>
		You utter foul words, summoning one demon from the chaos of the Abyss. You choose the demon's type, which must be 
		one of challenge rating 5 or lower, such as a shadow demon or a barlgura. The demon appears in an unoccupied space 
		you can see within range, and the demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. When you summon 
		it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no action on your part), 
		telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn attacking any creature 
		within reach that has attacked it.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">At the end of each of the demons turns, it makes a Charisma saving throw. 
		The demon has disadvantage on this saving throw if you say its true name. On a failed. save, the demon continues 
		to obey you. On a successful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of the duration, and the demon 
		spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest nondemons to the best of its ability. If you stop concentrating
		on the spell before it reaches its full duration, an uncontrolled demon doesn't disappear for 1d6 rounds if it 
		still has hit points.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with 
		the blood used as a material component. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the spell lasts, 
		the summoned demon can't cross the circle or harm it, and it can't target anyone within it. Using the material 
		component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot
		of 5th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by l for each slot level above 4th.</p>
