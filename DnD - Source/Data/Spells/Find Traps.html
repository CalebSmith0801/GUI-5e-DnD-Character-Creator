		You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, 
		includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was 
		specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the <i>alarm</i> spell, 
		a <i>glyph of warding</i>, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an 
		unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the 
		location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.</p>
