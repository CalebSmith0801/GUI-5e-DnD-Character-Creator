		<b>Giant Insect: (4th-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br><br>
		You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions 
		of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider,
		a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on 
		your turn each round. The DM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 
		0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The DM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if 
		you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.</p>
