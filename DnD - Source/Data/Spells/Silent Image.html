		<b>Silent Image: (1st-Level Illusion)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a bit of fleece.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br><br>
		You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 
		15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; 
		it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within
		range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for 
		the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it 
		appears to be walking.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an 
		illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can 
		determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save 
		DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.</p>
