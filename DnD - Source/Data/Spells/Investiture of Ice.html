		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>

		Until the spell ends, ice rimes your body, and you gain the following benefits:
		<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
			<li>You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage.</li>
			<li>You can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.</li>
			<li>The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. 
			The radius moves with you.</li>
			<li>You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind extending from your outstretched hand 
			in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes
			4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save 
			against this effect has its speed halved until the start of your next turn.</li>
		</ul>
