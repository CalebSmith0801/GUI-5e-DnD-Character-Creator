		<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S

		Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality
		from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or 
		half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw
		with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or 
		shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 
		5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
