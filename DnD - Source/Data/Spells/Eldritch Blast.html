		A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a
		hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two 
		beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same 
		target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.</p>
