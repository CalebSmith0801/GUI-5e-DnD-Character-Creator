		<b>Haste: (3rd-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a shaving of licorice root.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it
		gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each 
		of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, 
		or Use an Object action.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until 
		after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.</p>
