		one of the motes streaking toward one creature or object within 120 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged 
		spell attack. On a hit. the target takes 4d12 radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, the mote is expended. The 
		spell ends early if you expend the last mote.

		30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you have one to three motes remaining, they shed dim 
		light in a 30-foot radius.</p>

		of 8th level or higher, the number of motes created increases by two for each slot level above 7th.</p>
