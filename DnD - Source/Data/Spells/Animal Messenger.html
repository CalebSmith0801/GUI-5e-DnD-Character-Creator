		<b>Animal Messenger: (2nd-Level Enchantment (ritual))</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a morsel of food.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 24 hours<br><br>
		By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such 
		as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches
		a general description, such as "a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard" or "a red-haired dwarf 
		wearing a pointed hat." You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the 
		duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, 
		or 25 miles for other animals.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:0em;">When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message 
		to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature 
		matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message 
		is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 
		3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
