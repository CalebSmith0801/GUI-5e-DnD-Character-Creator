		You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution 
		saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The 
		damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum
		is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease 
		allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.
