		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>

		Until the spell ends, wind whirls around you, and you gain the following benefits:
		<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
			<li>Ranged weapon attacks made against you have disadvantage on the attack roll.</li>
			<li>You gain a flying speed of 60 feet. If you are still flying when the spell ends, you fall, unless you 
			can somehow prevent it.</li>
			<li>You can use your action to create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 
			60 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 
			bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller 
			creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.</li>
