		<b>Shillelagh: (Transmutation Cantrip)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 bonus action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 1 minute<br><br>
		The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature's power. For the duration, you can 
		use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that
		weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't already. The 
		spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.
