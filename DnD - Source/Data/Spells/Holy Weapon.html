		<b>Holy Weapon: (5th-Level Evocation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 bonus action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour<br><br>
		You imbue a weapon you touch with holy power. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot 
		radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 radiant 
		damage on a hit. If the weapon isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause 
		the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must 
		make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 1 
		minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded. At the end of each of its 
		turns, a blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
