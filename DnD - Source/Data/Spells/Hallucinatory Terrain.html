		<b>Hallucinatory Terrain: (4th-Level Illusion)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 300 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 24 hours<br><br>
		You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural 
		terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult 
		or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a 
		rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the 
		area aren't changed in appearance.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so 
		creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a 
		creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell 
		save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image 
		superimposed on the terrain.</p>
