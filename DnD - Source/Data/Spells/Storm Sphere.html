		A 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The 
		sphere remains for the spell's duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there
		must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The sphere's space is difficult terrain.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns 
		to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet
		of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere.
		On a hit, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom 
		(Perception) checks made to listen.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell 
		slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases for each of its effects by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
