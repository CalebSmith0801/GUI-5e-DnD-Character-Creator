		A shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you and 
		hedging out creatures other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:0em;">The barrier prevents an affected creature from 
		passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons 
		through the barrier.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the 
		barrier, the spell ends.</p>
