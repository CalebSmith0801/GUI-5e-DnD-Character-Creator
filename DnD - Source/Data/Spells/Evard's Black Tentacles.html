		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 90 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a piece of tenctacle from a giant octopus or giant squid.</li>
			</ul>

		Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these 
		tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or 
		starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be 
		restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already 
		restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a 
		Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.</p>
