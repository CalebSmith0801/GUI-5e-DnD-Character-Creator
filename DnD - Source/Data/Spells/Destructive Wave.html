		You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose 
		within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 thunder damage, as well as 5d6 radiant 
		or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as 
		much damage and isn't knocked prone.
