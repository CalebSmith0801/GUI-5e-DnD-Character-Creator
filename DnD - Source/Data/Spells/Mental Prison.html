		<b>Mental Prison: (6th-Level Illusion)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> S - You must have at least one free hand.<br>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		You attempt to bind a creature within an illusory cell that only it perceives. One creature you can see within 
		range must make an Intelligence saving throw. The target succeeds automatically if it is immune to being charmed. 
		On a successful save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends. On a failed save, the target takes 
		5d10 psychic damage, and you make the area immediately around the target's space appear dangerous to it in some 
		way. You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws 
		filled with dripping teeth. Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can't see or hear anything beyond it and 
		is restrained for the spell's duration. If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through 
		it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends.
