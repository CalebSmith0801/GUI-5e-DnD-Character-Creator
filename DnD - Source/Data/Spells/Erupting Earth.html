		Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot 
		cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 
		3d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in
		that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared away. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 
		1 minute to clear by hand.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell 
		slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
