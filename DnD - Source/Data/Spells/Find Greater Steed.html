		You summon a spirit that assumes the form of a loyal, majestic mount. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range,
		the spirit takes on a form you choose: a griffon, a pegasus, a peryton, a dire wolf, a rhinoceros, or a 
		saber-toothed tiger. The creature has the statistics provided in the <i>Monster Manual</i> for the chosen form, 
		though it is a celestial, a fey, or a fiend (your choice) instead of its normal creature type. Additionally, if it 
		has an Intelligence score of 5 or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one 
		language of your choice that you speak.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">You control the mount in combat. While the mount is within 1 mile of you, 
		you can communicate with it te1epathically. While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only 
		you also target the mount.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">The mount disappears temporarily when it drops to 0 hit points or when 
		you dismiss it as an action. Casting this spell again resummons the bonded mount, with all its hit points restored
		and any conditions removed.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">You can't have more than one mount bonded by this spell or <i>find steed</i>
		at the same time. As an action, you can release a mount from its bond, causing it to disappear permanently.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Whenever the mount disappears, it leaves behind any objects it was 
		wearing or carrying.</p>
