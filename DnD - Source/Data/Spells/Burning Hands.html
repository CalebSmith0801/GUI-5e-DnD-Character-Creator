		As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your 
		outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 
		fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn 
		or carried.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 
		2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
