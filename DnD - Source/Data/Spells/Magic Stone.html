		You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with
		one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, it has a range of 60 feet. If someone 
		else attacks with the pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attacker's, to the 
		attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Hit
		or miss, the spell then ends on the stone.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">If you cast this spell again, the spell ends early on any pebbles 
		still affected by it.</p>
