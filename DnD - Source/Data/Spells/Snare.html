		<b>Snare: (1st-Level Abjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
		<b>Components:</b> S, M
			<ul>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have 25 feet of rope, which the spell consumes.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 8 hours<br><br>
		As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When 
		you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence 
		(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the 
		ground or the floor in the spell's radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically
		hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is 
		restrained there until the spell ends.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">A restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of 
		each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can 
		reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the 
		restrained effect ends.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is 
		restrained by it.</p>
