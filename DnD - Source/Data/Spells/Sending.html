		You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature 
		hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner 
		immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of 
		your message.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">You can send the message across any distance and even to other 
		planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the 
		message doesn't arrive.</p>
