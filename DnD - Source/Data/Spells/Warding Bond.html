		This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the 
		spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has 
		resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target
		becom e separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures.
		You can also dismiss the spell as an action.</p>
