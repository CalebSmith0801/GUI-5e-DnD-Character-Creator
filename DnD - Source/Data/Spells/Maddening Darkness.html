		Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends.
		The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness. Nonmagical light, 
		as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. 
		Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 8d8 psychic damage on
		a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
