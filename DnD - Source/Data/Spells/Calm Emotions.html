		<b>Calm Emotions: (2nd-Level Enchantment)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>

			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a 
		point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it
		wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. 
		When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your 
		choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it 
		witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM 
		rules otherwise.</p>
