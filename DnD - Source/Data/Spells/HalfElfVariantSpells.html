		<b>Dancing Lights: (Evocation Cantrip)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 120 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a bit of phosphorous or wychwood or a glowworm.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that
		hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of 
		Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.<br>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet 
		to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks 
		out if it exceeds the spell's range.</p>

		<b>Faerie Fire: (1st-Level Evocation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V - You must be able to speak.<br>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in 
		the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, 
		objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if 
		the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.</p>

		<b>Darkness: (2nd-Level Evocation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>M - You must have bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br><br>
		Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The 
		darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light 
		can't illuminate it.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn't 
		being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the
		darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a 
		spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</p>
