		A strong wind (20 miles per hour) blows around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on 
		you. The wind lasts for the spell's duration. The wind has the following effects:
		<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
			<li>It deafens you and other creatures in its area.</li>
			<li>It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.</li>
			<li>The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.</li>
			<li>The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if they pass in or out of the wind.</li>
			<li>It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.</li>
		</ul>
