		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>

		You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears
		the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with
		the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence. 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet
		of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely 
		around corners or through openings.</p>
