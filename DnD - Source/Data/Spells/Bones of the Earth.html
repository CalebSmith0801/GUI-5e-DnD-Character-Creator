		<b>Bones of the Earth: (6th-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 120 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S

		<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><br>
		You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each 
		pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar 
		appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target ground under a creature if that creature is 
		Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into 
		rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius. The rubble lasts until cleared.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on 
		a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a 
		ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched 
		between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity 
		check (the creature's choice) against the spell's saving throw DC. On a success, the creature is no longer 
		restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell 
		slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.</p>
