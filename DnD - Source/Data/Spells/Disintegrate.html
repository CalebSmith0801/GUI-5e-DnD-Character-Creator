		A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a 
		creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by <i>wall of force</i>.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a 
		failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is 
		disintegrated.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except 
		magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a <i>true 
		resurrection</i> or a <i>wish</i> spell.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object 
		or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell 
		disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 
		7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.</p>
