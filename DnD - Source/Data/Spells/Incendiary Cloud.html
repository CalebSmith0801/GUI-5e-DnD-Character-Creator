		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 150 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>

		A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a 
		point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until 
		a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity 
		saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
		A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends
		its turn there.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that
		you choose at the start of each of your turns.</p>
