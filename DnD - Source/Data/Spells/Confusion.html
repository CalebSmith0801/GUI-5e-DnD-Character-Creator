		This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature 
		in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you
		cast this spell or be affected by it.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of
		each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.</p>

		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends
		for that target.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot 
		of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.</p>
