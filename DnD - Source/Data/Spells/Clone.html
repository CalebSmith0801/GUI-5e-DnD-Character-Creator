		<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><br>
		This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard against death. This clone forms inside a 
		sealed vessel and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger 
		version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its
		soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return. The clone is physically identical
		to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original's equipment. The 
		original creature's physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can't thereafter be restored to life, 
		since the creature's soul is elsewhere.</p>
