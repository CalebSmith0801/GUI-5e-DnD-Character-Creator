		Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a 
		padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred 
		becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">If you choose a target that is held shut with <i>arcane lock</i>, that spell 
		is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 
		feet, emanates from the target object.</p>
