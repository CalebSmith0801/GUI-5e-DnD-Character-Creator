		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>

		You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell 
		again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the 
		weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet 
		and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who 
		are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make 
		this spell's effect resemble that weapon.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell 
		slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above the 2nd.</p>
