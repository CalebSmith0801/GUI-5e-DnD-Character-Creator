		Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the 
		duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength 
		saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can 
		use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.</p>
