		<b>Flesh to Stone: (6th-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a pinch of lime, water, and earth.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. If the target's body is made of flesh, the 
		creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a 
		successful save, the creature isn't affected.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving 
		throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it 
		fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The 
		successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar 
		deformities if it reverts to its original state.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> If you maintain your concentration on this spell
		for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.</p>
