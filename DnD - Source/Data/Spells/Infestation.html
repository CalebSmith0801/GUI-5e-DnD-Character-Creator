		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>

				<li>M - You must have a living flea.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><br>
		You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range.
		The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it takes 1d6 poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random 
		direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east;
		or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target 
		doesn't move.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 
		11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>
