		<b>Spirit Guardians: (3rd-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Self (25-foot radius)<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a holy symbol.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br><br>
		You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you 
		are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear 
		fiendish.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures 
		you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature's speed is halved in the area, and when the creature 
		enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
		failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you
		are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell 
		slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
