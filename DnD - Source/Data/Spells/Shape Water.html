		<b>Shape Water: (Transmutation Cantrip)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> S - You must have at least one free hand.<br>
		<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)<br><br>
		You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. 
		You manipulate it in one of the following ways:
		<ul style="padding-left:20px">
			<li>You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any
			direction. This movement doesnâ€™t have enough force to cause damage.</li>
			<li>You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.</li>
			<li>You change the water's color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. 
			This change lasts for 1 hour.</li>
			<li>You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.</li>
		</ul>
		If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at 
		a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
