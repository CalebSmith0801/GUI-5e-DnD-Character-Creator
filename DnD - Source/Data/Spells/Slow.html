		<b>Slow: (3rd-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 120 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a drop of molasses.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must 
		succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and 
		Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus 
		action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or 
		ranged attack during its turn.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 
		action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the 
		creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving 
		throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.</p>
