		<b>Danse Macabre: (5th-Level Necromancy)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour<br><br>
		Threads of dark power leap from your fingers to pierce up to five Small or Medium corpses you can see within range. 
		Each corpse immediately stands up and becomes undead. You decide whether it is a zombie or a skeleton (the 
		statistics for zombies and skeletons are in the <i>Monster Manual</i>), and it gains a bonus to its attack and 
		damage rolls equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">You can use a bonus action to mentally command the creatures you make with
		this spell, issuing the same command to all of them. To receive the command, a creature must be within 60 feet of 
		you. You decide what action the creatures will take and where they will move during their next turn, or you can 
		issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or passageway against your foes. If you issue no commands, the 
		creatures do nothing except defend themselves against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creatures continue
		to follow it until their task is complete.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">The creatures are under your control until the spell ends, after which 
		they become inanimate once more.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot 
		of 6th level or higher, you animate up to two additional corpses for each slot level above 5th.</p>
