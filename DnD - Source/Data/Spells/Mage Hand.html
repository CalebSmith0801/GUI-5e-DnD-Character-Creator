		A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you 
		dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell 
		again.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:0em;">You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to 
		manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour 
		the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 
		pounds.</p>
