		A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your 
		equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if 
		you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you
		cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a 
		ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th 
		level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
