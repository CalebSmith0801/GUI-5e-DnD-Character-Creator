		<b>Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum: (4th-Level Abjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 120 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad cotton or cloth, and 
				powdered chrysolite.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 24 hours<br><br>
		You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100
		feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell 
		provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:</p>
		<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
			<li>Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.</li>
			<li>The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.</li>
			<li>Sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier 
			at its perimeter.</li>
			<li>Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells.</li>
			<li>Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.</li>
			<li>Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.</li>
		</ul>
		Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, 
		you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that
		can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.</p>
