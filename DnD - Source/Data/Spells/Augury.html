		By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, 
		you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to 
		take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:
		<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
			<li><i>Weal</i>, for good results</li>
			<li><i>Woe</i>, for bad results</li>
			<li><i>Weal and woe</i>, for both good and bad results</li>
			<li><i>Nothing</i>, for results that aren't especially good or bad</li>
		</ul>
		The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of
		additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next 
		long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. 
		The DM m akes this roll in secret.</p>
