		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 300 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>

		Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere 
		spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere's 
		area is difficult terrain.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution 
		saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
		one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn 
		or ends its turn there.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell 
		slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.</p>
