		<b>Drawmij's Instant Summons: (6th-Level Conjuration (ritual))</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a sapphire worth 1000 gp.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Until dispelled<br><br>
		You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an 
		invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material 
		component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">At any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item's name and 
		crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell
		ends.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire 
		doesn't transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where 
		that creature is located at that moment.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><i>Dispel magic</i> or a similar effect successfully applied to the 
		sapphire ends this spell's effect.</p>
