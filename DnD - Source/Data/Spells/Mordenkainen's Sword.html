		You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target
		of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you 
		can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this 
		attack against the same target or a different one.</p>
