		<b>Components:</b> V - You must be able to speak.<br>
		<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><br>
		You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target 
		can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage
		and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 
		11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).</p>

		<b>Charm Person: (1st-Level Enchantment)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 1 hour<br><br>
		You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with 
		advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the 
		spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly 
		acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 
		2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be 
		within 30 feet of each other when you target them.</p>

		<b>Enthrall: (2nd-Level Enchantment)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 1 minute<br><br>
		You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can 
		hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can't be charmed succeeds on this saving throw 
		automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, 
		the target has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell
		ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak.
