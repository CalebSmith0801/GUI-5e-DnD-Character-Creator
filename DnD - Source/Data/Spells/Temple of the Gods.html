		<b>Temple of the Gods: (7th-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 hour<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 120 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a holy symbol worth at least 5 gp.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 24 hours<br><br>
		You cause a temple to shimmer into existence on ground you can see within range. The temple must fit within an 
		unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side. The temple remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated to
		whatever god, pantheon, or philosophy is represented by the holy symbol used in the casting.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">You make all decisions about the temples appearance. The interior is 
		enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and as many windows as you 
		wish. Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">The temple's interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end. 
		You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell 
		of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">The temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell.
		Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen 
		type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can't 
		enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it 
		makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the 
		number rolled from the d20 roll.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">In addition, the sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside
		the temple, and creatures within can't be targeted by divination spells.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a 
		spell of let level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 
		hit point).</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the 
		Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temples interior. Nothing can physically pass through the 
		temple's exterior. It can't be dispelled by <i>dispei magic</i>, and <i>antimagic field</i> has no effect on it. A 
		<i>disintegrate</i> spell destroys the temple instantly.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this 
		effect permanent.</p>
