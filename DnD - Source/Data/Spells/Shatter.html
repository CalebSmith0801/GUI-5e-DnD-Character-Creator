		A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature 
		in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 
		3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic 
		material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the 
		damage if it's in the spell's area.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell 
		slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
