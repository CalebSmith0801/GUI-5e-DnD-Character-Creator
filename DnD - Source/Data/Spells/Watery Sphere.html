		<b>Watery Sphere: (4th-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 90 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a droplet of water.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		You conjure up a sphere of water with a 10-foot radius on a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover 
		in the air, but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell's duration.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">Any creature in the sphere's space must make a Strength saving throw. 
		On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space outside it. A Huge 
		or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically. On a failed save, a creature is restrained by the 
		sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving
		throw.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">The sphere can restrain a maximum of four Medium or smaller creatures or 
		one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature in excess of these numbers, a random creature that was 
		already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 feet of it.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. 
		If it moves over a pit, cliff, or other drop, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet over ground. Any 
		creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the
		saving throw, but no more than once per turn.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and 
		extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in
		the space where it falls.</p>
