		<b>Compelled Duel: (1st-Level Enchantment)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 bonus action<br>

		<b>Components:</b> V - You must be able to speak.<br>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		You attempt to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving 
		throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the duration, it has 
		disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it 
		attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell 
		doesn't restrict the target's movement for that turn.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell 
		that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a 
		harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.</p>
