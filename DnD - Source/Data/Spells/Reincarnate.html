		<b>Reincarnate: (5th-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 hour<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have rare oils and unguents worth at least 1000 gp, which the spell consumes.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><br>
		You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer 
		than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the 
		target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which 
		likely causes the creature's race to change. The DM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determine
		what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the DM chooses a form.</p>

		The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains the capabilities it had in its 
		original form, except it exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.
