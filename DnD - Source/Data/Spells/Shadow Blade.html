		You weave together threads of shadow to create a sword of solidified gloom in your hand. This magic sword lasts 
		until the spell ends. It counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. It deals 2d8 psychic damage
		on a hit and has the finesse, light, and thrown properties (range 20/60). In addition, when you use the sword to 
		attack a target that is in dim light or darkness, you make the attack roll with advantage
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">If you drop the weapon or throw it, it dissipates at the end of the turn.
		Thereafter, while the spell persists, you can use a bonus action to cause the sword to reappear in your hand.</p>
