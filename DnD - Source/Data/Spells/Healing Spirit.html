		You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot 
		cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into 
		the spirits space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore ld6 
		hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can't heal constructs or undead.</p>

		a space you can see.</p>

		of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
