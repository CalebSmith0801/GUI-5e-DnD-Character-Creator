		<b>Magic Circle: (3rd-Level Abjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 10 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 1 hour<br><br>
		You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you 
		can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, 
		elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:</p>
		<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
			<li>The creature can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use 
			teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.</li>
			<li>The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.</li>
			<li>Targets within the cylinder can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.</li>
		</ul>
		When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a 
		creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell 
		slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
