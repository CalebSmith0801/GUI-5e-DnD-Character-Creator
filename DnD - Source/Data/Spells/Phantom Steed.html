		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S

			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 1 hour<br><br>
		A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You
		decide the creature's appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created 
		by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The
		creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an 
		hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to 
		dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.</p>
