		<b>Web: (2nd-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a bit of spiderweb.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour<br><br>
		You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube 
		from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or 
		trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the 
		start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during 
		its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in 
		the webs or until it breaks free.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength 
		check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns
		away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.</p>
