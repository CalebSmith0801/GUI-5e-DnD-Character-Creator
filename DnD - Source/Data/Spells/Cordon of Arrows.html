		<b>Duration:</b> 8 hours<br><br>
		You plant four pieces of nonmagical ammunition (arrows or crossbow bolts) in the ground within range and lay magic 
		upon them to protect an area. Until the spell ends, whenever a creature other than you comes within 30 feet of the 
		ammunition for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, one piece of ammunition flies up to strike it. The 
		creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage. The piece of ammunition is then 
		destroyed. The spell ends when no ammunition remains.

		of 3rd level or higher, the amount of ammunition that can be affected increases by two for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
