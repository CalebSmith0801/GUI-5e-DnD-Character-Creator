		<b>Lightning Arrow: (3rd-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 bonus action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell's duration, the weapon's ammunition, or the weapon
		itself if it's a thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The target 
		takes 4d8 lightning damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon's normal damage.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target must
		make a Dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures takes 2d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as 
		much damage on a successful one.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell 
		slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 
		3rd.</p>
