		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>

		This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All 
		creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of 
		the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it
		can reach, thus avoiding the fall.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall,
		falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or 
		creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for 
		the duration.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall 
		back down.</p>
