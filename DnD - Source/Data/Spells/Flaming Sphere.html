		<b>Flaming Sphere: (2nd-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. 
		Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 
		fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the 
		sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops 
		moving this turn.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet 
		tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it
		sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 
		3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
