		<b>Catnap: (3rd-Level Enchantment)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> S, M
			<ul>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a pinch of sand.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 10 minutes<br><br>
		You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall
		unconscious for the spell's duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an 
		action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains unconscious for the full duration, that target gains the 
		benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot
		of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
