		<b>Zone of Truth: (2nd-Level Enchantment)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 10 minutes<br><br>
		You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice
		within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts 
		its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in
		the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering
		questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it
		remains within the boundaries of the truth.</p>
