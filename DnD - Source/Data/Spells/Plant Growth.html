		This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting 
		either immediate or long-term benefits.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All 
		normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the
		area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from 
		being affected.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants 
		in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the 
		normal amount of food when harvested.</p>
