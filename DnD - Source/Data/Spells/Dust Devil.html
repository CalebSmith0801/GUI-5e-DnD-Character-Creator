		<b>Dust Devil: (2nd-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a pinch of dust.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		Choose an unoccupied 5-foot cube of air that you can see within range. An elemental force that resembles a dust 
		devil appears in the cube and lasts for the spell's duration.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the dust devil must 
		make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet 
		away. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any 
		direction. If the dust devil moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or small gravel, it sucks up the material and 
		forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of debris around itself that lasts until the start of your next turn. The cloud 
		heavily obscures its area.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell 
		slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
