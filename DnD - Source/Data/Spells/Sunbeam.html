		A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line 
		must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until 
		your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes 
		have disadvantage on this saving throw.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the 
		spell ends.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It 
		sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.</p>
