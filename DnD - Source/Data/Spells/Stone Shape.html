		You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension 
		and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a 
		weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. 
		You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two 
		hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.
