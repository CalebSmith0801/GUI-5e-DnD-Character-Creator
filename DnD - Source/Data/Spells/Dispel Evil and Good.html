		Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material 
		Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against
		you.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">You can end the spell early by using either of the following special 
		functions.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Break Enchantments.</b> As your action, you touch a creature you can 
		reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The 
		creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>Dismissal.</b> As your action, make a melee spell attack against a 
		celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive he creature back 
		to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it 
		isn't there already). If they aren't on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the 
		Feywild.</p>
