		<b>Control Flames: (Transmutation Cantrip)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> S - You must have at least one free hand.<br>
		<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)<br><br>
		You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one 
		of the following ways:
		<ul style="padding-left:20px">
			<li>You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present 
			in the new location.</li>
			<li>You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.</li>
			<li>You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The 
			change lasts for 1 hour.</li>
			<li>You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear 
			within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.</li>
		</ul>
		If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, 
		and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
