		<b>Conjure Animals: (3rd-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour<br><br>
		You summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts and appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. 
		Choose one of the following options for what appears:
		<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
			<li>One beast of challenge rating 2 or lower</li>
			<li>Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower</li>
			<li>Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower</li>
			<li>Eight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower</li>
		</ul>
		The DM has the creatures' statistics. Each beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit 
		points or when the spell ends.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll 
		initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you 
		issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from 
		hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using certain 
		higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many 
		with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.</p>
