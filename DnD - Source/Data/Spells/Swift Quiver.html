		<b>Swift Quiver: (5th-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 bonus action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a quiver containing at least one piece of ammunition.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		You transmute your quiver so it produces an endless supply of nonmagical ammunition, which seems to leap into your hand
		when you reach for it.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to
		make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver. Each time you make such a ranged attack, your 
		quiver magically replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical ammunition. Any pieces of
		ammunition created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell 
		ends.</p>
