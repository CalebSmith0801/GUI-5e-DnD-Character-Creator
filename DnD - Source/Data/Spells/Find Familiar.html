		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 hour<br>

		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>

		You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, 
		lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an 
		unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or 
		fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. 
		In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions
		as normal.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no 
		physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it 
		telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the 
		start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are 
		deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a 
		pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is 
		temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while 
		you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. 
		Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can 
		deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its 
		reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for 
		the roll.</p>
