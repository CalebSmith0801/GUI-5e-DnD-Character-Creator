		<b>Stinking Cloud: (3rd-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 90 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud 
		spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its 
		turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action 
		that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically 
		succeed on this saving throw.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud 
		after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.</p>
