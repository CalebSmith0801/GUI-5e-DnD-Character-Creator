		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path 
		to higher status. You have the service of three retainers. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one
		might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight 
		for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are 
		frequentlyendangered or abused. One of your commoner retainers is a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in 
		exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to 
		care for your horse and a servant who polishes your arm or (and even helps you put it on).</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might 
		include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart-in
		a chaste sort of devotion. (This person could be your bond.)</p>
