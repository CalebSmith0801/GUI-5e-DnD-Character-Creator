		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">Before you became an adventurer, your life was already full of conflict and excitement,
		because you made a living tracking down people for pay. Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren't
		a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You're involved in a lucrative trade, in the place 
		where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What's more, you aren't alone, as a bounty
		hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, 
		maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed.</p>
		<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch 
		one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings 
		of thieves' guilds and street gangs. You might be a "velvet mask" bounty hunter, one who blends in with high 
		society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists.
		The community where you plied your trade might have been one of Faerun's great metropolises, such as Waterdeep or 
		Baldur's Gate, or a less populous location, perhaps Luskan or Yartar-any place that's large enough to have a steady
		supply of potential quarries.</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult 
		to pursue a personal agenda that doesn't fit with the group's objectives-but on the other hand, you can take down 
		much more formidable targets with the help of your companions.</p>
