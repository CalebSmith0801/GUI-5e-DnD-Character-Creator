		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">You have served the community where you grew up, standing as its first line of defense
		against crime. You aren't a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. Instead, your service to your
		hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe.</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">You might have been part of the City Watch of Waterdeep, the 
		baton-wielding police force of the City of Splendors, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy nobility 
		alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or even one 
		of the magic-wielding Spellguard.</p>

			locations rather than the latter.</p>
