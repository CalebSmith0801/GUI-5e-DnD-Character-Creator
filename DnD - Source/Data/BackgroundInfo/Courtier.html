		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">In your earlier days, you were a personage of some significance in a noble court or a 
		bureaucratic organization. You might or might not come from an upper-class family; your talents, rather than the 
		circumstances of your birth, could have secured you this position.</p>
		<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">You might have been one of the many functionaries, attendants, and other 
		hangers-on in the Court of Silverymoon, or perhaps you traveled in Waterdeep's baroque and sometimes cutthroat 
		conglomeration of guilds, nobles, adventurers, and secret societies. You might have been one of the behind-the-scenes
		law-keepers or functionaries in Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter, or you might have grown up in and around the castle 
		of Daggerford.</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Even if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the group that gave 
		you your start in life, your relationships with your former fellows can be an advantage for you and your 
		adventuring comrades. You might undertake missions with your new companions that further the interest of the 
		organization that gave you your start in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed whileserving as a 
		courtier will stand you in good stead as an adventurer.</p>
