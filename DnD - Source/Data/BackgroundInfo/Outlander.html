		You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the comforts of town and technology. You've witnessed the 
		migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, 
		and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction. The wilds are in your 
		blood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in places 
		where you don't know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of the wild.<br><br>
