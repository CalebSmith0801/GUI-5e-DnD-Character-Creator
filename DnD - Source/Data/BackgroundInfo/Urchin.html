		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor. You had no one to watch over you 
		or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant 
		watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to 
		the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You've survived 
		despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">You begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly 
		but securely for at least ten days. How did you come by that money? What allowed you to break free of your 
		desperate circum stances and embark on a better life?</p>
