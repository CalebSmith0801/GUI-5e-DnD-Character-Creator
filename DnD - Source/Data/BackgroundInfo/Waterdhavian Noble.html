		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">You are a scion of one of the great noble families of Waterdeep. Human families who 
		jealously guard their privilege and place in the City of Splendors, Waterdhavian nobles have a reputation across 
		Faerun for being eccentric, spoiled, venal, and, above all else, rich.</p>
		<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">Whether you are a shining example of the reason for this reputation or one 
		who proves the rule by being an exception, people expect things of you when they know your surname and what it 
		means. Your reasons for taking up adventuring likely involve your family in some way: Are you the family rebel, who
		prefers delving in filthy dungeons to sipping zzar at a ball? Or have you taken up sword or spell on your family's 
		behalf, ensuring that they have someone of renown to see to their legacy?</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Work with your DM to come up with the family you are part of-there are 
		around seventy-five lineages in Waterdeep, each with its own financial interests, specialties, and schemes. You 
		might be part of the main line of your family, possibly in line to become its leader one day. Or you might be one 
		of any number of cousins, with less prestige but also less responsibility.</p>

			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">While you are in Waterdeep or elsewhere in the North your house sees to your 
			everyday needs. Your name and signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the inns, taverns, and 
			festhalls you frequent are glad to record your debt and send an accounting to your family's estate in Waterdeep
			to settle what you owe.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">This advantage enables you to live a comfortable lifestyle without
			having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that amount. 
			You may not maintain a less affluent lifestyle and use the difference as income-the benefit is a line of 
			credit, not an actual monetary reward.</p>
