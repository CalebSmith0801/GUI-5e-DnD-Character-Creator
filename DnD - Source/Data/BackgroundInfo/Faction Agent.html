		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">Many organizations active in the North and across the face of Faerun aren't bound by 
		strictures of geography. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their 
		members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, 
		sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction's operatives), haven 
		keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don't merely fulfill a
		small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart.</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you 
		served as an agent of a particular faction in Faerun. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the 
		faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn't necessarily 
		require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your 
		status in the faction.</p>

		<div class="panel">
			<p><b>The Harpers</b><br>Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the 
			Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through 
			knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be 
			adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, 
			and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harpers' ideals.</p>
			<p><b>The Order of the Gauntlet</b><br>One of the newest power groups in Faerun, the Order of the Gauntlet has 
			an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet 
			are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. 
			Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the 
			order's ideals, and the clergy of the order's patron gods. </p>
			<p><b>The Emerald Enclave</b><br>Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that 
			threaten that balance is the two fold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of 
			survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, 
			hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods of nature. </p>
			<p><b>The Lords' Alliance</b><br>On one level, the agents of the Lords' Alliance are representatives of the 
			cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that 
			transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the 
			organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely 
			on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the 
			Alliance's ideals.</p>
			<p><b>The Zhentarim.</b><br>In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as 
			the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates 
			from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren't necessarily 
			criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in 
			Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the Zhentarim.</p>

		<button class="accordion">Safe Haven</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide 
			assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such 
			operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in 
			finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.</p>
