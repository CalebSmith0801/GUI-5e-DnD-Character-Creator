		You are a member of an artisan's guild, skilled in a particular field and closely associated with other artisans. 
		You are a well-established part of the mercantile world, freed by talent and wealth from the constraints of a 
		feudal social order. You learned your skills as an apprentice to a master artisan, under the sponsorship of your 
		guild, until you became a master in your own right.<br><br>

			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that 
			membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your 
			funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other mem bers of your 
			profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a 
			crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. 
			You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. 
			Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss 
			payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.</p>
