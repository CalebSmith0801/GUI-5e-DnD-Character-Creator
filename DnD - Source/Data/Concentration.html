		<b>Concentration:</b> You cannot cast any other spell that requires concentration while concentrating on this one, 
		though you can perform any other action. If you cast another spell that requires concentration, you lose concetration
		on this one. If you take damage, you have to roll a Con check equal to 10 or half the damage you take, whichever is greater.<br><br>
		You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the 
		creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain
		hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.<br>
