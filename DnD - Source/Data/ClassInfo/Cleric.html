		Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they 
		serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine 
		magic.<br><br>

		<div class="panel">
			<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric

	    </div>
		
		<button class="accordion">Preparing and Casting Spells</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your 
			spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the 
			spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to 
			cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your 
			Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have 
			spell slots.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and
			two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 
			2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <i>cure wounds</i>, you can cast it using a 
			1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long 
			rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per

		<div class="panel">
			<p>Choose one domain related to your deity. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and 
			each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features
			when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that 
			feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Domain Spells</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">Each domain has a list of spells-its dom ain spells-that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain 
			description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number
			of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell

		<button class="accordion">Channel Divinity</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your 
			deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect 
			determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the 
			domain description.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. 
			You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such 
			an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice 
			between rests, and beginning at 18th level. you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short 
			or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each
			undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails 
			its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away 
			from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions.
			For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. 
			If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>

			an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>

		<button class="accordion">Bard College</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice, detailed at the end of

		<div class="panel">
			<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing

			frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The perform ance ends early if

		<b><Font size=5 style = "Font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">Bard Colleges</Font></b><br><hr/>
		
		<button class="accordion">College of Lore</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of 
			knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns
			or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the 
			applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from
			their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not 
			in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor 
			knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual 
			colleges, complete with classroom sand dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at 
			festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at selfimportant 
			figures of authority.</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></p>
			When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Cutting Words</b></p>
			Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and 
			competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability 
			check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling 
			a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use 
			this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability 
			check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or
			if it's immune to being charmed.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Additional Magical Secrets</b></p>
			At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can
			cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count 
			against the number of bard spells you know.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Peerless Skill</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em">Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of 
			Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can 
			choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed 
			or fail.</p>
	    </div>
		
		
		<button class="accordion">College of Valor</button>
		<div class="panel">
			Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the 
			past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great 
			bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events 
			firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they 
			inspire others to reach the sam  heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></p>
			When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and 
			martial weapons.

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Combat Inspiration</b></p>
			Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you 
			can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack 
			roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number 
			rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Extra Attack</b></p>
			Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Battle Magic</b></p>
			At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious act. 
			When you use your action to cast a bard spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
