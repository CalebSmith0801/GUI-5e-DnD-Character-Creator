		The barbarian is a primal warrior who prefers to charge in to engage foes in melee. Barbarians are defined by their 
		rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a 
		cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.<br><br>

			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing 
			heavy armor:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
				<li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that 
				increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Barbarian Table panel in Class Features above.</li>
				<li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
			</ul>
			If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if
			your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since
			then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in

		<div class="panel">
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you

			turn.</p>

		<button class="accordion">Danger Sense</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge

			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to

			Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While 
			you're raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which 
			hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't 
			against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to 
			the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.<br>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Spirit Shield</b></p>
			Beginning at 6th level, the guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. 
			If you are raging and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to 
			reduce that damage by 2d6.
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">When you reach certain levels in this class. you can reduce the damage
			by more: by 3d6 at 10th level and by 4d6 at 14th level.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Consult the Spirits</b></p>
			At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the <i>augury</i> 
			or <i>clairvoyance</i> spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical
			sensor, this use of <i>clairvoyance</i> invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. 
			Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">After you cast either spell in this way, you can't use this feature

		<button class="accordion">Path of the Battlerager</button>
		<div class="panel">
			Known as Kuldjargh (literally "axe idiot") in Dwarvish, battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war 
			and take the Path of the Battlerager. They specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves 
			into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle. 
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Restriction: Dwarves Only</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. The battlerager fills a particular 
			niche in dwarven society and culture.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. The restriction exists
			for the Forgotten Realms. It might not apply to your DM's setting or your DM's version of the Realms.</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Battlerager Armor</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use spiked armor 
			as a weapon, detailed below.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one
			melee weapon attack with your armor spikes against a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the 
			spikes deal 1d4 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">Additionally, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature, the target takes 3 
			piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds.</p>
			<p><b>Spike Armor</b><br>
			Spiked armor is a rare type of medium armor made by dwarves. It consists of a leather coat and leggings covered

			<b>Cost:</b> 75 gp<br>

			Beginning at 10th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action while you are raging.

			Starting at 14th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes 3

			For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end--that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path

			heedless of your own health or well-being.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Frenzy</b></p>
			Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Intimidating Presence</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing 
			presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see 
			or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma 
			modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action 
			to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect

			<p style="margin:0em">All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians 
			who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls
			around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical 
			effects.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside

			whenever you gain a level in this class.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your 
			proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Desert.</b> When this effect is activated, all other creatures in 
			your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing 
			to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Sea.</b> When this effect is activated, you can choose one other 
			creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning
			damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain
			levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Tundra.</b> When this effect is activated, each creature of your
			choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as icy spirits inure it to suffering. The temporary hit 
			points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at
			15th level, and 6 at 20th level.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Storm Soul</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">At 6th level, the storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn't active. The 
			benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Desert.</b> You gain resistance to fire damage, and you don't suffer
			the effects of extreme heat. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable object that isn't being worn or

			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Sea.</b> You gain resistance to lightning damage, and you can breathe
			underwater. You also gain a swimming speed of 30 feet.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Tundra.</b> You gain resistance to cold damage, and you don't 
			suffer the effects of extreme cold. Moreover, as an action, you can touch water and turn a 5-foot cube Of it 
			into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature is in the cube.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Shielding Storm</b></p>
			At 10th level, you learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice has 
			the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul fea ture while the creature is in your Storm Aura.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Raging Storm</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">At 14th level, the power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your 
			foes. The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Desert.</b> Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with 
			an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, 
			the creature takes fire damage equal to half your barbarian level.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Sea.</b> When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you 
			can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is
			knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Tundra.</b> Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, 
			you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or

		<button class="accordion">Path of the Totem Warrior</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p style="margin:0em">The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit 
			animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, 
			adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a 
			particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, 
			though exceptions exist.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Spirit Seeker</b></p>
			Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level 
			when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the <i>beast sense</i> and <i>speak with animals</i> spells, 
			but only as rituals.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Totem Spirit</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and 
			gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object-an amulet or similar adornment-that 
			incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor 
			physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, 
			you might be unusually hairy and thickskinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but 
			more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Bear.</b> While raging, you have resistance to all damage except 
			psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Eagle.</b> While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other
			creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus
			action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Elk.</b> While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, your 
			walking speed increases by 15 feet. The spirit of the elk makes you extraordinarily swift.
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Tiger.</b> While raging, you can add 10 feet to your long jump 
			distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. The spirit of the tiger empowers your leaps.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Wolf.</b> While you're raging, your friends have advantage on 
			melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf 
			makes you a leader of hunters.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Aspect of the Beast</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You 
			can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Bear.</b> You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity 
			(including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, 
			pull, lift, or break objects.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Eagle.</b> You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 
			mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100
			feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Elk.</b> Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as 
			is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you and you're not incapacitated. 
			The elk spirit helps you roam far and fast.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Tiger.</b> You gain proficiency in two skills from the following list: 
			Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Survival. The cat spirit hones your survival instincts.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Wolf.</b> You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can 
			track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal 
			pace.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Spirit Walker</b></p>
			At 10th level, you can cast the <i>commune with nature</i> spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a 
			spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to 
			convey the information you seek.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Totemic Attunement</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can
			choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Bear.</b> While you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that's
			hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this 
			feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Eagle.</b> While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your 
			current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and 
			nothing else is holding you aloft.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Elk.</b> While raging, you can use a bonus action during your move to
			pass through the space of a Large or smaller creature. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw 
			(DC 8 + your Strength bonus + your proficiency bonus) or be knocked prone and take bludgeoning damage equal to 
			1d12 +your Strength modifier.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Tiger.</b> While you're raging, if you move at least 20 feet in a 
			straight line toward a Large or smaller target right before making a melee weapon attack against it, you can 
			use a bonus action to make an additional melee weapon attack against it. </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Wolf.</b> While you're raging, you can use a bonus action 
			on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with melee weapon attack.</p>

		<button class="accordion">Path of the Zealot</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p style="margin:0em">Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle 
			fury. These barbarians are zealots-warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine 
			power.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">A variety of gods across the worlds of D&D inspire their 
			followers to embrace this path. Tempus from the Forgotten Realms and Hextor and Erythnul of Greyhawk are
			all prime examples. In general, the gods who inspire zealots are deities of combat, destruction, and 
			violence. Not all are evil, but few are good.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Divine Fury</b></p>
			Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While 
			you're raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal 
			to 1d6 + half your barbarian level. The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when 
			you gain this feature.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Warrior of the Gods</b></p>
			At 3rd level, your soul is marked for endless battle. If a spell, such as <i>raise dead</i>, has the sole effect
			of restoring you to life (but not uncleath), the caster doesn't need material components to cast the spell on 
			you.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Fanatical Purpose</b></p>
			Starting at 6th level, the divine power that fuels your rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while 
			you're raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Zealout Presence</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">At 10th level, you learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in others. As a bonus
			action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 
			feet of you that can hear you gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next 
			turn.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish 
			a long rest.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Rage Beyond Death</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">Beginning at 14th level, the divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off 
			fatal blows.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">While you're raging, having 0 hit points doesn't knock you 
			unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while 
			at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage 
			ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.</p>
