		The barbarian is a primal warrior who prefers to charge in to engage foes in melee. Barbarians are defined by their 
		rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a 
		cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.<br><br>

			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing 
			heavy armor:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
				<li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that 
				increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian 
				table.</li>
				<li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
			</ul>
			If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
			<p style="margin:0em">Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if
			your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since
			then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in 
			the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>
