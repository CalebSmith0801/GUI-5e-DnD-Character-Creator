		The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, 
		using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending
		themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward 
		charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects 
		and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their 
		minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.<br><br>

		<b><Font size=5 style = "Font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">Bard Colleges</Font></b><br><hr/>
		
		<button class="accordion">College of Glamore</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">The College of Glamour is the home of bards who mastered their craft in the 
			vibrant realm of the Feywild or under the tutelage of someone who dwelled there. Tutored by satyrs, eladrin, 
			and other fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and 
			fear. Their performances are the stuff Of legend. These bards are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of
			them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The
			same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off 
			a community for weeks, misusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic bards of this college 
			instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors.</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Mantle of Inpiration</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">When you join the College of Glamour at 3rd level, you gain the ability to weave a 
			song of fey magic that imbues your allies with vigor and speed.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to 
			grant yourself a wondrous appearance. When you do so, choose a number of creatures you can see and that can see
			you within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of them gains 
			5 temporary hit points. When a creature gains these temporary hit points, it can immediately use its reaction to
			move up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">The number of temporary hit points inoreases when you reach certain
			levels in this class, increasing to 8 at 5th level, 11 at 10th level, and 14 at 15th level.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Enthralling Performance</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">Starting at 3rd level, you can charge your performance with seductive, fey magic.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire wonder
			in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the end of the performance, choose a number of
			humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your Charisma 
			modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be 
			charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who 
			talks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined 
			to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, 
			or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that 
			you tried to charm it.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish 
			a short or long rest.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Mantle of Majesty</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">At 6th level, you gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that makes others want
			to serve you. As a bonus action, you cast <i>command</i>, without expending a spell slot, and you take on an 
			appearance of unearthly beauty for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a 
			spell). During this time, you can cast <i>command</i> as a bonus action on each of your turns, without 
			expending a spell slot.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">Any creature charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against
			the command you cast with this feature.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish 
			a long rest.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Unbreakable Majesty</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">At 14th level, your appearance permanently gains an otherworldly aspect that makes you 
			look more lovely and fierce.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">In addition, as a bonus action, you can assume a magically majestic 
			presence for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack 
			you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On 
			a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack 
			is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw 
			it makes against your spells on your next turn.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Once you assume this majestic presence, you can't do so again until
			you finish a short or long rest.</p>
	    </div>
		
		
		<button class="accordion">College of Lore</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of 
			knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns
			or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the 
			applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from
			their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not 
			in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor 
			knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual 
			colleges, complete with classroom sand dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at 
			festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at selfimportant 
			figures of authority.</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></p>
			When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Cutting Words</b></p>
			Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and 
			competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability 
			check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling 
			a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use 
			this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability 
			check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or
			if it's immune to being charmed.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Additional Magical Secrets</b></p>
			At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can
			cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count 
			against the number of bard spells you know.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Peerless Skill</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em">Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of 
			Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can 
			choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed 
			or fail.</p>
	    </div>
		
		
		<button class="accordion">College of Swords</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through 
			daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, 
			and mock combats. Though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors 
			in their own right.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. 
			One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail.
			Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are 
			happy to accept a blade's talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust 
			a blade in their ranks.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Blades who abandon their lives as entertainers have often run into
			trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in 
			vigilante justice is too great a liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these blades 
			either take up work as enforcers for thieves' guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">When you join the College of Swords at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium 
			armor and the scimitar.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">If you‘re proficient with a simple or martial melee weapon, you 
			can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Fighting Style</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">At 3rd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the 
			following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if something in the game lets
			you choose again.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Dueling.</b> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and
			no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Two-Weapon Fighting</b>. When you engage in two weapon 
			fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Blade Flourish</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">At 3rd level, you learn to perform impressive displays of martial prowess and speed.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, your walking speed 
			increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if a weapon attack that you make as part of this action 
			hits a creature, you can use one of the following Blade Flourish options of your choice. You can use only one
			Blade Flourish option per turn.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Defensive Flourish.</b> You can expend one use of your Bardic 
			Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you 
			roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You also add the number rolled to your AC until the start of your next 
			turn.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Slashing Flourish.</b> You can expend one use of your Bardic 
			Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit and to any other creature of your 
			choice that you can see within 5 feet of you. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration 
			die.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px"><b>Mobile Flourish.</b> You can expend one use of your Bardic 
			Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number 
			you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You can also push the target up to 5 feet away from you, plus a number
			of feet equal to the number you roll on that die. You can then immediately use your reaction to move up to 
			your walking speed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Extra Attack</b></p>
			Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action 
			on your turn.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Master's Flourish</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em">Starting at 14th level, whenever you use a Blade Flourish option, you can roll a d6 and use it 
			instead of expending a Bardic Inspiration die.</p>

		<button class="accordion">College of Valor</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the 
			past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great 
			bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events 
			firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they 
			inspire others to reach the sam  heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></p>
			When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and 
			martial weapons.

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Combat Inspiration</b></p>
			Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you 
			can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack 
			roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number 
			rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Extra Attack</b></p>
			Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Battle Magic</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em">At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious act. 
			When you use your action to cast a bard spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>

		<button class="accordion">College of Whispers</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of 
			Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like other bards, sharing news, singing songs, and 
			telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they 
			are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against 
			others through extortion and threats.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a 
			parasite that uses a bard's reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members of this college 
			rarely reveal their true nature. They typically claim to follow some other college, or they keep their actual 
			calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Psychic Blades</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you gain the ability to make your 
			weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature's mind.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one 
			use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an extra 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per 
			round on your turn.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this 
			class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Words of Terror</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can
			inspire terror.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt
			to seed paranoia in its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw 
			against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened
			in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or 
			damaged.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that
			you tried to frighten it.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish 
			a short or long rest.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Mantle of Whispers</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">At 6th level, you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid's persona. When a humanoid dies 
			within 30 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You retain this shadow until 
			you use it or you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, 
			magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy and 
			alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">While you're in the disguise, you gain access to all information that 
			the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its 
			background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself
			off as the person by drawing on its memories.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a 
			Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can't capture 
			another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Shadow Lore</b></p>
			<p style="margin:0em">At 14th level, you gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a 
			creature's deepest fears.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of 
			your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save 
			DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn't share a language with you or if it can't hear you. On a successful 
			saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">On a failed saving throw, the target is charmed by you for the next 8 
			hours or until you or your allies attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw. It interprets the 
			whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain no knowledge of this secret, but the target 
			is convinced you know it.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">The charmed creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal 
			its secret. It won't risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants
			you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held 
			you in such fear.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
			a long rest.</p>
