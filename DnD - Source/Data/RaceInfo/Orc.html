		Orcs are a race of humanoids that have been a threat to the civilized cultures of Toril, particularly Faerun 
		for as long as any can remember. Orcs have poor temperaments and are given to anger more easily than some races. 
		Traditional orcish culture is extremely warlike and when not at war the race is usually planning for it. 
		Most orcs approach life with the belief that to survive, one must subjugate potential enemies and control as much 
		resources as possible, which puts them naturally at odds with other races as well as each other.<br><br>
