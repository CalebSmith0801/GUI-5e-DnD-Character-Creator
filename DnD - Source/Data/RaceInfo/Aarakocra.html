		Sequestered in high mountains atop tall trees, the aarakocra, sometimes called birdfolk, 
		evoke fear and wonder. Many aarakocra aren't even native to the Material Plane. 
		They hail from a world beyond - from the boundless vistas of the Elemental Plane of Air.
		They are immigrants, refugees, scouts, and explorers, their outposts functioning as footholds 
		in a world both strange and alien.<br><br>
