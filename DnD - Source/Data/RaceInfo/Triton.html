		Tritons guard the ocean depths, building small settlements beside deep trenches, portals to the elemental planes, 
		and other dangerous spots far from the eyes of land-bound folk. Long-established guardians of the deep ocean floor, 
		in recent years the noble tritons have become increasingly active in the world above.<br><br>

				<p><b>Fog Cloud: (1st-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
				<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>

				<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour<br>
				<b>Description:</b> You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere
				spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of 
				moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.<br>
				<b>At Higher Levels:</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of 
				the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.</p>

			<button class="accordion" style="font-size:14px; padding: 5px">Gust of Wind</button>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 0em;"><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up tp 1 minute<br>
				<b>Description:</b> A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you
				choose for the spell's duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength 
				saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top:0em;">Any creature in the line must spend 2 
				feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top:0em;">The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it
				extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, 
				such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell 
				ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.</p>

			<div class="panel" id="sub">
				<p><b>Wall of Water: (3rd-Level Evocation)</b><br>
				<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
				<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
				<b>Components:</b> V, S, M</p>
				<ul>
					<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>

				<p style="margin-bottom:0em";><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>
				<b>Description:</b> You conjure up a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. 
				You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and l foot thick, or you can make a ringed wait up
				to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall's 
				space is difficult terrain.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space has
				disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to
				reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wan they 
				pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot square section is frozen), Each 5-foot square frozen section 
				has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed,
				the wall's water doesn't fill it.</p>
