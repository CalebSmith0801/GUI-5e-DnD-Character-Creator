		Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, 
		but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests 
		in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. 
		The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.<br><br>

				<b>Description:</b> One creature or object of your choice that you can see
				within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate
				a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw
				is unaffected.</p>
				
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0em;">The target can move only by pushing or pulling
				against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as	a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move 
				as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. 
				If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action 
				to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range. When the spell ends, the target 
				floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.</p>
