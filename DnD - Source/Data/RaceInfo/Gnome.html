		A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their closeknit 
		communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, 
		a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying 
		every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.<br><br>

			Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.</p>

			<div class="panel" id="sub">
				<p><b>Minor Illusion: (Illusion Cantrip)</b><br>
				<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
				<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
				<b>Components:</b> S, M</p>
				<ul>
					<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
					<li>M - You must have a bit of fleece.</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0em;"><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute<br>
				<b>Description:</b> You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. 
				The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.</p>
				
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em;">If you create a sound, its volume can range 
				from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any 
				other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at
				different times before the spell ends.</p>
				
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em;">If you create an image of an object - such as 
				a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest - it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create
				sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an 
				illusion, because things can pass through it.</p>
				
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0em;">If a creature uses its action to examine 
				the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence 
				(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, 
				the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</p>

			to three such devices active at a time.</p>
			
			<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0em;">When you create a device, choose one of the following options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Clockwork Toy:</b> This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird,
				dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns
				in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.</li>
				<li><b>Fire Starter:</b> The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch,
				or campfire. Using the device requires your action.</li>
				<li><b>Music Box:</b> When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops
				playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.</li>
