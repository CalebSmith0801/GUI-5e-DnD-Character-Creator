		woods. When provoked, firbolgs demonstrate formidable skills with weapons and druidic magic.<br><br>

			<p>You can cast <b>Detect Magic</b> and <b>Disguise Self</b> with this trait, using Wisdom as your spell casting 
			ability for them. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it again with this trait until you finish a short or 
			long rest. When you use this version of disguise self, you can seem up to 3 feet shorter than normal, allowing you 
			to more easily blend in with humans and elves.</p>
		
			<button class="accordion" style="font-size:14px; padding: 5px">Detect Magic</button>
			<div class="panel" id="sub">
				<p><b>Detect Magic: (1st-Level Divination)</b><br>
				<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
				<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
				<b>Components:</b> V, S</p>
				<ul>
					<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
					<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0em;"><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>
				<b>Description:</b> For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense
				magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the
				area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any. </p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0em;">The spell can penetrate most barriers, 
				but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p>
			</div>
			
			<button class="accordion" style="font-size:14px; padding: 5px">Disguise Self</button>
			<div class="panel" id="sub">
				<p><b>Disguise Self: (1st-Level Illusion)</b><br>
				<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
				<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
				<b>Components:</b> V, S</p>
				<ul>
					<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
					<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0em;"><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour<br>
				<b>Description:</b> You make yourself (including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person) look 
				different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and 
				can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic
				arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em;">The changes wrought by this spell fail to
				hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass
				through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this
				spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while
				it was seemingly still in midair.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0em;">To discern that you are disguised, a creature
				can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against
				your spell save DC.</p>
