		Purebloods were described as human-like but with minor reptilian features, such as snake-like eyes, a forked tongue,
		and patches of scales on their skin. While not as powerful as other yuan-ti forms, purebloods still had 
		psionic powers. Like all yuan-ti, they tended to be arrogant and self-centered. Purebloods were the least likely of
		the true yuan-ti breeds to remain attached to their tribe. Since they could more easily disguise themselves, 
		they had the freedom to pursue their own interests wherever such things took them. Purebloods served a special role
		in yuan-ti society by being the liaisons, agents, spies, or assassins, as they could usually readily hide their
		serpentine features. <br><br>

				<p><b>Duration:</b> 24 hours<br>
				<b>Description:</b> This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you 
				can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails.
				Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell's duration. 
				If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spells ends.<br>
				<b>At Higher Levels:</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect
				one additional beast for each slot level above 1st.</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom:0em";><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 8 hours<br>
				<b>Description:</b> You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence
				a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are 
				immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound
				reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some 
				other obviously harmful act ends the spell.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-bottom:0em; margin-top:0em;">The target must make a Wisdom saving throw.
				On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested
				course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a
				shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-bottom:0em; margin-top:0em;">You can also specify conditions that will
				trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her 
				warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity
				isn't performed.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell
				ends.</p>
