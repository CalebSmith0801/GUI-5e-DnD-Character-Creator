		Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely 
		part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or 
		in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air 
		and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry,
		music and poetry, and the good things of the world.<br><br>

		<div class="panel">
			<p>Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of 
			adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood
			and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>

		<div class="panel">
			<p>Elves love freedom, variety, and selfexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos.
			They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. 
			The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. 
			Drow are more often evil than not.</p>

			<button class="accordion" style="font-size:14px; padding: 5px">Dancing Lights</button>
			<div class="panel" id="sub">
				<p><b>Dancing Lights: (Evocation Cantrip)</b><br>
				<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
				<b>Range:</b> 120 feet<br>
				<b>Components:</b> V, S, M</p>
				<ul>
					<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
					<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
					<li>M - You must have a bit of phosporous or wychwood.</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="margin-bottom:0em";><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>
				<b>Description:</b> You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, 
				lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into 
				one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 
				10-foot radius.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">As a bonus action on your turn, you can move 
				the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created 
				by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.</p>

			<button class="accordion" style="font-size:14px; padding: 5px">Faerie Fire</button>
			<div class="panel" id="sub">
				<p style="margin-bottom:0em";><b>Faerie Fire: (1st-Level Evocation)</b><br>
				<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
				<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
				<b>Components:</b> V - You must be able to speak.<br>
				<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 Minute<br>
				<b>Description:</b> Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light 
				(your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity
				saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Any attack roll against an affected creature
				or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from 
				being invisible.</p>

			<button class="accordion" style="font-size:14px; padding: 5px">Darkness</button>
			<div class="panel" id="sub">
				<p><b>Darkness: (2nd-Level Evocation)</b><br>
				<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
				<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
				<b>Components:</b> V, M</p>
				<ul>
					<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
					<li>M - You must have bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal.</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="margin-bottom:0em";><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>
				<b>Description:</b> Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere
				for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness,
				and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top:0em;">If the point you choose is on an object you 
				are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. 
				Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; 0em; margin-top:0em;">If any of this spell's area overlaps with an 
				area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</p>
