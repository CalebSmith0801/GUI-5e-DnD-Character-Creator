		At the highest mountain peaks, far above the slopes where trees grow and where the air is thin and the frigid winds
		howl, dwell the reclusive goliaths. Few folk can claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still can claim friendship
		with them. Goliaths wander a bleak realm of rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are carved from 
		mountain stone and give them great physical power. Their spirits take after the wandering wind, making them nomads
		who wander from peak to peak. Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each
		goliath with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying.<br><br>
