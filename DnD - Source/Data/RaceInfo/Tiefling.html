		To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in
		every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own
		way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be 
		a friend, but when a tiefling's companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend
		the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life.<br><br>
