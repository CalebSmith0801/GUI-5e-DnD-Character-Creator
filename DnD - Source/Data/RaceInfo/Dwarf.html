		Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, 
		the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment 
		to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs-these common 
		threads unite all dwarves.<br><br>

			<p>When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <b>Enlarge/Reduce</b> spell on yourself once with this trait, 
			using only the spell's enlarge option. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the <b>Invisibility</b> spell on 
			yourself once with this trait. You don't need material components for either spell, and you can't cast them 
			while you're in direct sunlight, although sunlight has no effect on them once cast. You regain the ability to
			cast these spells with this trait when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for
			these spells.</p>
			
			<button class="accordion" style="font-size:14px; padding: 5px">Enlarge/Reduce</button>
			<div class="panel" id="sub">
				<p><b>Enlarge/Reduce: (2nd-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
				<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
				<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
				<b>Components:</b> V, S</p>
				<ul>
					<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
					<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="margin-bottom:0em";><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>
				<b>Description:</b> You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger for the 
				duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is 
				unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and 
				carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.<br>
				<b>Enlarge:</b> The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth 
				increases its size by one category, from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target 
				to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the
				spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's
				weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with them
				deal 1d4 extra damage.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
					<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
					<li>M - You must have an eyelash encased in gum arabic.</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="margin-bottom:0em";><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour<br>
				<b>Description:</b> A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is 
				wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends for a target that
				attacks or casts a spell.<br>
				<b>At Higher Levels:</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can 
				target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
