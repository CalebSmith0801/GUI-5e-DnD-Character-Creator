		The barbarian is a primal warrior who prefers to charge in to engage foes in melee. Barbarians are defined by their 
		rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a 
		cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.<br><br>

		<button class="accordion">Rage</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing 
			heavy armor:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
				<li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that 
				increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian 
				table.</li>
				<li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
			</ul>
			If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if
			your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since
			then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in 
			the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>

		<button class="accordion">Reckless Attack</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you 
			make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee 
			weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next 
			turn.</p>
	    </div>
		
		<button class="accordion">Danger Sense</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge 
			when you dodge away from danger.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To 
			gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</p>

		<button class="accordion">Primal Path</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage, detailed below. Your choice grants you

		<button class="accordion">Ability Score Improvement</button>

		<div class="panel">
			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative 
			rolls.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated,
			you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</p>

		<div class="panel">

		<button class="accordion">Relentless Rage</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If
			you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving 
			throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish 
			a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>

			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to 
			protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Ancestral Protectors</b></p>
			Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While 
			you're raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which 
			hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't 
			against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to 
			the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.<br>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Spirit Shield</b></p>
			Beginning at 6th level, the guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. 
			If you are raging and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to 
			reduce that damage by 2d6.
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">When you reach certain levels in this class. you can reduce the damage
			by more: by 3d6 at 10th level and by 4d6 at 14th level.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Consult the Spirits</b></p>
			At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the <i>augury</i> 
			or <i>clairvoyance</i> spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical
			sensor, this use of <i>clairvoyance</i> invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. 
			Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">After you cast either spell in this way, you can't use this feature 
			again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:0em"><b>Vengeful Ancestors</b></p>
			At 14th level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce
			the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage that your Spirit Shield
			prevents.<br>
