		You perform a special religious ceremony that is infused with magic. When you cast the spell, choose one of the 
		following rites, the target of which must be within 10 feet of you throughout the casting.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Atonement.</b> You touch one willing creature whose alignment has 
		changed, and you make a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a successful check, you restore the target to its 
		original alignment.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Bless Water.</b> You touch one vial of water and cause it to become
		holy water.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Coming one.</b> You touch one humanoid who is a young adult. For 
		the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes an ability check, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the
		ability check. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Dedication.</b> You touch one humanoid who wishes to be dedicated 
		to your god's service. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes a saving throw, it can roll a d4 and 
		add the number rolled to the save. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Funeral Rite.</b> You touch one corpse, and for the next 7 days, 
		the target can't become undead by any means short of a <i>wish</i> spell.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>Wedding.</b> You touch adult humanoids willing to be bonded 
		together in marriage. For the next 7 days, each target gains a +2 bonus to AC while they are within 30 feet of 
		each other. A creature can benefit from this rite again only if widowed.</p>
