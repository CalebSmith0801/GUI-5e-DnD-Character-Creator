		Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target 
		you. You cast that spell-called the contingent spell-as part of casting <i>contingency</i>, expending spell slots for both,
		but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You 
		describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a <i>contingency</i> cast with <i>water breathing</i> might
		stipulate that <i>water breathing</i> comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met
		for the first time, whether or not you want it to. and then <i>contingency</i> ends.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally
		target others. You can use only one <i>contingency</i> spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of 
		another <i>contingency</i> spell on you ends. Also, <i>contingency</i> ends on you if its material component is ever
		not on your person.</p>
