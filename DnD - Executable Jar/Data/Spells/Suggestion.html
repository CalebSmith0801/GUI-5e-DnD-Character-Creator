		<b>Suggestion: (2nd-Level Enchantment)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a snake's tongue and either a bit homneycomb or drop of sweet oil.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 8 hours<br><br>
		You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within 
		range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must
		be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw 
		itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the
		course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire 
		duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what 
		it was asked to do.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during 
		the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the 
		condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.</p>
