		You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded 
		creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the 
		creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature 
		from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that 
		affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.</p>
