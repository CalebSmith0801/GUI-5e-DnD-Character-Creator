		<b>Programmed Illusion: (6th-Level Illusion)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 120 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Until dispelled<br><br>
		You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when 
		a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and
		you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can 
		last up to 5 minutes.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence 
		and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant 
		for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, 
		though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you 
		could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could 
		set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, 
		because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is 
		an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns
		the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the 
		creature.</p>
