		A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a 
		Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.
		On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect
		are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible 
		out to 300 feet.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
		2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
