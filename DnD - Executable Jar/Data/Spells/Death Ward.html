		damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an 
		effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target,
