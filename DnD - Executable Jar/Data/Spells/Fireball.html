		A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar
		into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity 
		saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area 
		that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 
		4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
