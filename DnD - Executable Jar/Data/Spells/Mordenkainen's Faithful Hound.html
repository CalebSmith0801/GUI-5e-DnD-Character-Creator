		<b>Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound: (4th-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 8 hours<br><br>
		You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see within range, where it remains for the 
		duration, until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can't be harmed. 
		When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when
		you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the 
		Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one 
		creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound's attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability
		modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.</p>
