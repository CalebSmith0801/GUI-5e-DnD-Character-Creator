		<b>Fire Shield: (4th-Level Evocation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a bit of phosphorus or a firefly.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 10 minutes<br><br>
		Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for
		an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. 
		The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a 
		melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage 
		from a cold shield.</p>
