		You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it 
		dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end 
		of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.</p>
