		<b>Geas: (5th-Level Enchantment)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V - You must be able to speak.<br>
		<b>Duration:</b> 30 days<br><br>
		You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or
		refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must 
		succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by 
		you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no 
		more than once each day. A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would 
		result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A <i>remove 
		curse</i>, <i>greater restoration</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell also ends it.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot
		of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell 
		lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.</p>
