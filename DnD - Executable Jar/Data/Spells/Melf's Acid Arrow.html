		A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell 
		attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of 
		its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no 
		damage at the end of its next turn.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot 
		of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
