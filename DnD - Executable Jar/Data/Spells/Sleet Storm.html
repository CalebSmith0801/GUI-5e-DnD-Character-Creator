		<b>Sleet Storm: (3rd-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a pinch of dust and a few drops of water.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on 
		a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult 
		terrain. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must 
		make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area, the creature 
		must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.</p>
