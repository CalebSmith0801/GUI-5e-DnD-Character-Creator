		<b>Gentle Repose: (2nd-Level Necromancy (ritual))</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse's eyes, which 
				must remain there for the duration.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 10 days<br><br>
		You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can't become undead.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the 
		target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit of 
		spells such as <i>raise dead</i>.</p>
