		<b>Project Image: (7th-Level Illusion)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 500 miles<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a small replica of you made from materials worth at least 5 gp.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 day<br><br>
		You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within 
		range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is
		intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and 
		make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in 
		its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. 
		While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, 
		because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is 
		an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns
		the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the 
		creature.</p>
