		<b>Catapult: (1st-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 150 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> S - You must have at least one free hand.<br>
		<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><br>
		Choose one object weighing 1 to 5 pounds within range that isn't being worn or carried. The object flies in a 
		straight line up to 90 feet in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts 
		against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving 
		throw. On a failed save, the object strikes the target and stops moving. In either case, both the object and the 
		creature or solid surface take 3d8 bludgeoning damage.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell 
		slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum weight of objects that you can target with this spell increases by 5 
		pounds, and the damage increases by 1d8, for each slot level above 1st.</p>
