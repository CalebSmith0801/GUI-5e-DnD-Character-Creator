		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M

		You fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition from a ranged weapon or throw a nonmagical weapon into the air and choose
		a point within range. Hundreds of duplicates of the ammunition or weapon fall in a volley from above and then 
		disappear. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a Dexterity 
		saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage 
		type is the same as that of the ammunition or weapon.
