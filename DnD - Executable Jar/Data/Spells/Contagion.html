		Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict 
		the creature with a disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:0em;">At the end of each of the target's turns, it must
		make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease's effects last for the 
		duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature
		recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:0em;">Since this spell induces a natural disease in its 
		target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it.</p>

		mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is
		blinded.</p>

		that use Strength.</p>

		creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:0em;"><b>Mindfire.</b>  The creature's mind becomes 
		feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature 
		behaves as if under the effects of the confusion spell during combat.</p>
