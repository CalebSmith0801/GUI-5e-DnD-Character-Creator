		<b>Forbiddance: (6th-Level Abjuration (ritual))</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and powdered ruby worth at least 1000 gp.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 1 day<br><br>
		You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet 
		above the floor. For the duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the
		<i>gate</i> spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures
		from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the <i>plane shift</i> spell.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you 
		cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature
		enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or 
		necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks
		the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The spell's area can't overlap with the area of another <i>forbiddance</i> spell. 
		If you cast <i>forbiddance</i> every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the 
		material components are consumed on the last casting.</p>
