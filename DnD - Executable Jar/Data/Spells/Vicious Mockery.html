		You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target 
		can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage
		and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 
		11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).</p>
