		You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy. The wall appears within range and 
		lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed
		wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures 
		behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">When a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn 
		there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On 
		a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.</p>
