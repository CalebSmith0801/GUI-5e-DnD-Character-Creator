		<b>Moonbeam: (2nd-Level Evocation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 120 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar.</li>

		A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range.
		Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or 
		starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution 
		saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it 
		also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to 
		move the beam 60 feet in any direction.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot 
		of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
