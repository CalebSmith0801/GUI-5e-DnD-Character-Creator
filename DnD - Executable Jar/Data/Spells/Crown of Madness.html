		<b>Crown of Madness: (2nd-Level Enchantment)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 120 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>

			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by 
		you for the duration. While the target is charmed in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and
		a madness glows in its eyes.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">The charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to 
		make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. The target can act normally on its
		turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control 
		over the target, or the spell ends. Also, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. 
		On a success, the spell ends.</p>
