		<b>Guards and Wards: (6th-Level Abjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small

			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 24 hours<br><br>
		You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot
		squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You 
		can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each 
		contiguous area while you are casting the spell
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected 
		by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the 
		speaker immune to these effects.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><i>Guards and wards</i> creates the following effects within the warded 
		area.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Corridors.</b> Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily 
		obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 
		percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it 
		chooses.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Doors.</b> All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if 
		sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the 
		illusory object function of the <i>minor illusion</i> spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Stairs.</b> Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, 
		as the <i>web</i> spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while <i>guards and 
		wards</i> lasts.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Other Spell Effect.</b> You can place your choice of one of the 
		following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.</p>
		<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
			<li>Place <i>dancing lights</i> in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as 
			long as <i>guards and wards</i> lasts.</li>
			<li>Place <i>magic mouth</i> in two locations.</li>
			<li>Place <i>stinking cloud</i> in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return 
			within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while <i>guards and wards</i> lasts.</li>
			<li>Place a constant <i>gust of wind</i> in one corridor or room .</li>
			<li>Place a <i>suggestion</i> in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature 
			that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.</li>
		</ul>
		The whole warded area radiates magic. A <i>dispel magic</i> cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes 
		only that effect.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by 
		casting this spell there every day for one year.</p>
