		<b>Control Winds: (5th-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 300 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>

		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour<br><br>
		You take control of the air in a 100-foot cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following 
		effects when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell's duration, unless you use your action on a 
		later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to 
		restart one you've halted.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em"><b>Gusts.</b> A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a 
		horizontal direction that you choose. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the 
		wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that pass through it or that are made against targets within 
		the cube have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind 
		must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;"><b>Downdraft.</b> You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to 
		blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against
		targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a Strength saving throw if it 
		flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature 
		is knocked prone.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>Updraft.</b> You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, 
		rising upward from the cube's bottom edge. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from 
		the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than 
		normal.</p>
