		<b>Illusory Script: (1st-Level Illusion (ritual))</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
		<b>Components:</b> S, M
			<ul>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a lead-based ink worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 10 days<br><br>
		You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that 
		lasts for the duration.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the 
		writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text.
		To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. 
		Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different 
		hand and language, though the language must be one you know.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion 
		both disappear.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.</p>
