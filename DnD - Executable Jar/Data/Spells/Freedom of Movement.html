		<b>Freedom of Movement: (4th-Level Abjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a leather strap, bound around the arm or similar appendage.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 1 hour<br><br>
		You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and 
		other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from 
		nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no 
		penalties on the target's movement or attacks.</p>
