		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 10 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>

				<li>M - You must have burning incense.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 10 minutes<br><br>
		You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to 
		answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can't be undead. The spell fails if the 
		corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five 
		questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually 
		brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are 
		hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, 
		only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has 
		happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.</p>
