		<b>Feign Death: (3rd-Level Necromancy (ritual))</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a pinch of graveyard dirt.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> 1 hour<br><br>
		You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">For the spell's duration, or until you use an action to touch the target 
		and dismiss the spell, the target appears dead to all outward inspection and to spells used to determine the target's 
		status. The target is blinded and incapacitated, and its speed drops to 0. The target has resistance to all damage 
		except psychic damage. If the target is diseased or poisoned when you cast the spell, or becomes diseased or poisoned
		while under the spell's effect, the disease and poison have no effect until the spell ends.</p>
