		<b>Create Homunculus: (6th-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 hour<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have clay, ash, and mandrake root, all of which the spell consumes, and a jewel-encrusted 
				dagger worth at least 1000 gp.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><br>
		While speaking an intricate incantation, you cut yourself with a jewel-encrusted dagger, taking 2d4 piercing damage 
		that can't be reduced in any way. You then drip your blood on the spell's other components and touch them, 
		transforming them into a special construct called a homunculus.
		<p style="text-indent: 15Px; margin:0em;">The statistics of the homunculus are in the <i>Monster Manual</i>. It is your 
		faithful companion, and it dies if you die. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can spend up to half your Hit Dice
		if the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as you. When you do so, roll each die and add your Constitution
		modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, and the homunculus's hit point maximum and current
		hit points are both increased by it. This process can reduce you to no lower than 1 hit point. and the change to 
		your and the homunculus's hit points ends when you finish your next long rest. The reduction to your hit point 
		maximum can't be removed by any means before then, except by the homunculus's death.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">You can have only one homunculus at a time. If you cast this spell 
		while your homunculus lives, the spell fails.</p>
