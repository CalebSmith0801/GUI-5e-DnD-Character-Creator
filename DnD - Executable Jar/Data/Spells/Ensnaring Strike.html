		<b>Ensnaring Strike: (1st-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 bonus action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V - You must be able to speak.<br>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears 
		at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the magical vines 
		until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on the 
		save, the vines shrivel away.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">While restrained by this spell, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage at the 
		start of each of its turns. A creature restrained by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action 
		to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 
		2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
