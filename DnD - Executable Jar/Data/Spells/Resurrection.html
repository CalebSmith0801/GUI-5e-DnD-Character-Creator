		<b>Resurrection: (7th-Level Necromancy)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 hour<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a diamond worth at least 1000 gp, which the spell consumes.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><br>
		You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn't die of old age, and that 
		isn't undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases 
		afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if 
		such effects aren't removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body 
		parts.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty 
		to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty
		is reduced by 1 until it disappears.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been 
		dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can't cast spells again, and 
		you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>
