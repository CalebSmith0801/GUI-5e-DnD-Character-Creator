		<b>Banishing Smite: (5th-Level Abjuration)</b><br>

		<b>Components:</b> V - You must be able to speak.<br>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, your weapon crackles with force, and the
		attack deals an extra 5d10 force damage to the target. Additionally, if this attack reduces the target to 50 hit 
		points or fewer, you banish it. If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you're on, the
		target disappears, returning to its home plane. If the target is native to the plane you're on, the creature vanishes
		into a harm less demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. It remains there until the spell ends, at which
		point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
