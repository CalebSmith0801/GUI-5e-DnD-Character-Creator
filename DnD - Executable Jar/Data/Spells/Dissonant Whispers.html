		<b>Dissonant Whispers: (1st-Level Enchantment)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V - You must be able to speak.<br>
		<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><br>
		You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible
		pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately 
		use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn't move into 
		obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and 
		doesn't have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 
		2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
