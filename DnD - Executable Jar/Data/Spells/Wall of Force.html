		An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any 
		orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a 
		solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can 
		shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In 
		any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it
		appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all 
		damage and can't be dispelled by <i>dispel magic</i>. A <i>disintegrate</i> spell destroys the wall instantly, 
		however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.</p>
