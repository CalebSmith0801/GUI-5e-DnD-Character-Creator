		<b>Maze: (8th-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br><br>
		You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the 
		duration or until it escapes the maze.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it 
		makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon 
		automatically succeeds).</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if 
		that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.</p>
