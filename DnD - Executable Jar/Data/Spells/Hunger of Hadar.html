		<b>Hunger of Hadar: (3rd-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 150 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a pickled octopus tentacle.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		You open a gateway to the dark between the stars, a region infested with unknown horrors. A 20-foot-radius 
		sphere of blackness and bitter cold appears, centered on a point with range and lasting for the duration. This 
		void is filled with a cacophony of soft whispers and slurping noises that can be heard up to 30 feet away. No 
		light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> The void creates a warp in the fabric of 
		space, and the area is difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 cold damage. 
		Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 acid damage as 
		milky, otherworldly tentacles rub against it.</p>
