		<b>Wall of Thorns: (6th-Level Conjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 120 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a handful of thorns.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br><br>
		You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range
		on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 
		feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line
		of sight.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity 
		saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For 
		every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a 
		creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes
		7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot 
		of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.</p>
