		<b>Melf's Minute Meteors: (3rd-Level Evocation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have niter, sulfur, and pine tar formed into a bead.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br><br>
		You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you
		cast the spell-and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter-you can expend one or two of the meteors, 
		sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its 
		destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point 
		where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save,
		or half as much damage on a successful one.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell 
		slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
