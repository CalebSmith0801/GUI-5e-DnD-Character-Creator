		You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60 
		feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a <i>hallow</i> spell. The 
		affected area is subject to the following effects.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can't enter the 
		area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, 
		or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can 
		exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect 
		from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the DM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the 
		area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or 
		leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters 
		the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On 
		a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em"><b>Courage.</b> Affected creatures can't be frightened while in the 
		area.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em"><b>Darkness.</b> Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as 
		magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can't illuminate the
		area.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em"><b>Daylight.</b> Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created 
		by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell can't extinguish the light.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em"><b>Energy Protection.</b> Affected creatures in the area have 
		resistance to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em"><b>Energy Vulnerability.</b> Affected creatures in the area have 
		vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em"><b>Everlasting Rest.</b> Dead bodies interred in the area can't be 
		turned into undead.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em"><b>Extradimensional Interference.</b> Affected creatures can't move or
		travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em"><b>Fear.</b> Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em"><b>Silence.</b> No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound
		can reach into it.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>Tongue.</b> Affected creatures can communicate with 
		any other creature in the area, even if they don't share a common language.</p>
