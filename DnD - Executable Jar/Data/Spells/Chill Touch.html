		You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the 
		creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain
		hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.<br>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:0em;">If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls 
		against you until the end of your next turn.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:0em;">This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 
		11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
