		<b>Spike Growth: (2nd-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 150 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br><br>
		The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The 
		area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 
		piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. 
		Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check 
		against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.</p>
