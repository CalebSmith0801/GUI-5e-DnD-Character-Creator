		For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use 
		your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its 
		school of magic, if any.

		stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p>
