		You attempt to charm a creature you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and it does so with 
		advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the 
		spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature is friendly to you. 
		When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

		be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.</p>
