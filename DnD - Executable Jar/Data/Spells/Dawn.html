		The light of dawn shines down on a location you specify within range. Until the spell ends, a 30-foot-radius. 
		40-foot-high cylinder of bright light glimmers there. This light is sunlight.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">When the cylinder appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution 
		saving throw, taking 4d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature 
		must also make this saving throw whenever it ends its turn in the cylinder.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">If you're within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 
		feet as a bonus action on your turn.</p>
