		<b>Counterspell: (3rd-Level Abjuration)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> S - You must have at least one free hand.<br>

		You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd 
		level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability 
		check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails 
		and has no effect.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot 
		of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the 
		spell slot you used.</p>
