		<b>Wind Wall: (3rd-Level Evocation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 120 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet 
		long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous
		path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength 
		saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or 
		smaller flying creatures or objects can't pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall 
		fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward 
		and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) 
		Creatures in gaseous form can't pass through it.</p>
