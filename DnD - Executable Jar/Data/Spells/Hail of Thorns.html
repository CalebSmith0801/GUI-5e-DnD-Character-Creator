		<b>Components:</b> V - You must be able to speak.<br>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		The next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack before the spell ends, this spell creates a rain 
		of thorns that sprouts from your ranged weapon or ammunition. In addition to the normal effect of the attack, 
		the target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature 
		takes 1d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> If you cast this spell using a spell slot
		of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st (to a maximum of 6d10).</p>
