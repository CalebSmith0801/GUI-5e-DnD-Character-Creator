		<b>Investiture of Stone: (6th-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br><br>
		Until the spell ends, bits of rock spread across your body, and you gain the following benefits:
		<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
			<li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</li>
			<li>You can use your action to create a small earthquake on the ground in a 15-foot radius centered on you. 
			Other creatures on that ground must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
			<li>You can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone without spending extra movement. You can 
			move through solid earth or stone as if it was air and without destabilizing it, but you can't end your 
			movement there. If you do so, you are ejected to the nearest unoccupied space, this spell ends, and you are 
			stunned until the end of your next turn.</li>
		</ul>
