		You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition into the air to create a cone of identical 
		weapons that shoot forward and then disappear. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity saving 
		throw. A creature takes 3d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is 
		the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.
