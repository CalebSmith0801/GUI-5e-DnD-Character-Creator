		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>

		<b>Duration:</b> 1 minute<br><br>
		You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must
		ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em;">Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" 
		as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word 
		answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer 
		instead.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long
		rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes 
		this roll in secret.</p>
