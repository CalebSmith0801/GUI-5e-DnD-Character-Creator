		<b>Maximillian's Earth Grasp: (2nd-Level Transmutation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a miniature hand sculpted from clay.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from 
		compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a 
		Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the 
		spell's duration.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, who
		must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
		successful one.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">To break out, the restrained target can make a Strength check against 
		your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different 
		creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do
		either.</p>
