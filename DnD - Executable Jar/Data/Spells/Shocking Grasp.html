		Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack 
		against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, 
		the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 
		11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
