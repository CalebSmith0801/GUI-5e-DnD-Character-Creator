		<b>Witch Bolt: (1st-Level Evocation)</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> 30 feet<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
				<li>M - You must have a twig from a tree that has been struck by lightning.</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
		A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning 
		between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 
		lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage
		to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the 
		target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has total cover from you.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot 
		of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
