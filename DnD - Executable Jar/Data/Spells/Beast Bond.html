		You establish a telepathic link with one beast you touch that is friendly to you or charmed by you. The spell 
		fails if the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher. Until the spell ends, the link is active while you and the 
		beast are within line of sight of each other. Through the link, the beast can understand your telepathic 
		messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you. While the link 
		is active, the beast gains advantage on attack rolls against any  creature within 5 feet of you that you can see.
