		You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its 
		area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per 
		hour) disperses it.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 
		2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.</p>
