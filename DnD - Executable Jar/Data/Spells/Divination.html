		<b>Divination: (4th-Level Divination (ritual))</b><br>
		<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
		<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
		<b>Components:</b> V, S, M
			<ul>
				<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
				<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>

				least 25 gp, which the spell consumes.</li>

		<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><br>
		Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god's servants. You ask a single question concerning a 
		specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short 
		phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin:0em">The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might 
		change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long
		rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM 
		makes this roll in secret.</p>
