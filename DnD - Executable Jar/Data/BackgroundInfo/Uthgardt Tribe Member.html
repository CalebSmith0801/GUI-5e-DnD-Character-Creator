		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">Though you might have only recently arrived in civilized lands, you are no stranger to
		the values of cooperation and group effort when striving for supremacy. You learned these principles, and much more,
		as a member of an Uthgardt tribe.</p>
		<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">Your people have always tried to hold to the old ways. Tradition and taboo 
		have kept the Uthgardt strong while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos and ruin. But for the last few
		generations, some bands among the tribes were tempted to settle, make peace, trade, and even to build towns. 
		Perhaps this is why Uthgar chose to raise up the totems among the people as living embodiments of his power. 
		Perhaps they needed a reminder of who they were and from whence they came. The Chosen of Uthgar led bands back to 
		the old ways, and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of civilization.</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">You might have grown up in one of the tribes that had decided to settle
		down, and now that they have abandoned that path, you find yourself adrift. Or you might come from a segment of the
		Uthgardt that adheres to tradition, but you seek to bring glory to your tribe by achieving great things as a 
		formidable adventurer.</p>
