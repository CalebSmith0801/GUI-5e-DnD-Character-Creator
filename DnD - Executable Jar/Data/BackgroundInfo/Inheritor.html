		You are the heir to something of great value not mere coin or wealth, but an object that has been entrusted to you
		and you alone. Your inheritance might have come directly to you from a member of your family, by right of birth, or
		it could have been left to you by a friend, a mentor, a teacher, or someone else important in your life. The 
		revelation of your inheritance changed your life, and might have set you on the path to adventure, but it could 
		also come with many dangers, including those who covet your gift and want to take it from you-by force, if need be.<br><br>

			<p style="margin-bottom:0em">Choose or randomly determine your inheritance from among the possibilities in the 
			table below. Work with your DM to come up with details: Why is your inheritance so important, and what is its 
			full story? You might prefer for the DM to invent these details as part of the game, allowing you to learn 
			more about your inheritance as your character does.</p>
			<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">The DM is free to use your inheritance as a story hook, sending you 
			on quests to learn more about its history or true nature, or confronting you with foes who want to claim it for
			themselves or prevent you from learning what you seek. The DM also determines the properties of your 
			inheritance and how they figure into the item's history and importance. For instance, the object might be a 
			minor magic item, or one that begins with a modest ability and increases in potency with the passage of time. 
			Or, the true nature of your inheritance might not be apparent at first and is revealed only when certain 
			conditions are met.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">When you begin your adventuring career, you can decide whether to 
			tell your companions about your inheritance right away. Rather than attracting attention to yourself, you might
			want to keep your inheritance a secret until you learn more about what it means to you and what it can do for 
			you.</p>
