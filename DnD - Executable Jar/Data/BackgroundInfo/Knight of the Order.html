		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">You belong to an order of knights who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The 
		nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable 
		endeavor. Faerun has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their 
		actions and responsibilities.</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Though the term "knight" conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored 
		warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faerun don't restrict their membership to such individuals. The 
		goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most
		of these orders aren't limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and 
		die for the order's cause.</p>

		<div class="panel">
			<p><b>Knights of the Unicorn</b><br>The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and 
			daughters of patriar families in Baldur's Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and 
			went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue's tenets. 
			Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn
			are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests 
			should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and 
			everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their weaknesses.</p>
			<p><b>Knights of Myth Drannor</b><br>Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and 
			Dove Falcon hand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great 
			but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove 
			Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the 
			civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again
			ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they've begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted 
			by Dove herself, are above all valiant and honest.</p>
			<p><b>Knights of the Silver Chalice</b><br>The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod 
			Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe's ethos is the nobility's right and responsibility to rule, 
			and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe 
			at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of 
			Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in 
			Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown.</p>

			<p>You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims.
			If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. 
			Knights of civic orders can get help from the community-whether a lone settlement or a great nation that they 
			serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals,
			and those who share those ideals.</p>
