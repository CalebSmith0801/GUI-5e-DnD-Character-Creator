		You lived in seclusion-either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone-for a formative part
		of your life. In your time apart from the clam or of society, you found quiet, solitude, and perhaps some of the 
		answers you were looking for.<br><br>

			powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a 
			great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It
			could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, 
			or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging
			to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and
