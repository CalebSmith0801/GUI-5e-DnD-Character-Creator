		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family
		owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat 
		unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel 
		with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply 
		about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how 
		much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn't stand on its own-it's connected to an entire family, and 
		whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble 
		title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>
