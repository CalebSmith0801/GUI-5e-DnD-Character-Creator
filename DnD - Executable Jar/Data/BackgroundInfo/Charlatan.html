		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick, you can tease 
		out their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them 
		like they were children's books. Itâ€™s a useful talent, and one that you're perfectly willing to use for your 
		advantage.</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to 
		deliver. Common sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true, but common sense seems 
		to be in short supply when you're around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure that unseemly rash, 
		this ointment-nothing more than a bit of fat with a sprinkle of silver dust-can restore youth and vigor, and 
		there's a bridge in the city that just happens to be for sale. These marvels sound implausible, but you make them 
		sound like the real deal.</p>
