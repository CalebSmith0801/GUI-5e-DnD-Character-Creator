		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">The Stout Folk are well known for their artisanship and the worth of their handiworks,
		and you have been trained in that ancient tradition. For years you labored under a dwarf master of the craft, 
		enduring long hours and dismissive, sour-tempered treatment in order to gain the fine skills you possess today.</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">You are most likely a dwarf, but not necessarily-particularly in the 
		North, the shield dwarf clans learned long ago that only proud fools who are more concerned for their egos than 
		their craft turn away promising apprentices, even those of other races. If you aren't a dwarf, however, you have 
		taken a solemn oath never to take on an apprentice in the craft: it is not for nondwarves to pass on the skills of 
		Moradin's favored children. You would have no difficulty, however, finding a dwarf master who was willing to 
		receive potential apprentices who came with your recommendation.</p>
