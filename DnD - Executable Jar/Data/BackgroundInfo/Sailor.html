		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced down mighty storms, 
		monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is the 
		distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new.</p>
		<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed with your DM. Was 
		it a merchant ship, a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship? How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it 
		widely traveled? Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost with all hands?</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">What were your duties on board-boatswain, captain, navigator, cook, or 
		some other position? Who were the captain and first mate? Did you leave your ship on good terms with your fellows, 
		or on the run?</p>

			<p>When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions.
			You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained 
			by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will
			meet your every need. Your DM will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your 
			free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.</p>
