		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">As a sell-sword who fought battles for coin, you're well acquainted with risking life 
		and limb for a chance at a share of treasure. Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater 
		rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you 
		likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit such as the 
		Zhentarim or the soldiers of Mintarn, or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one.</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Now you're looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the 
		risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you're leaving behind the life 
		of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a different way.</p>
