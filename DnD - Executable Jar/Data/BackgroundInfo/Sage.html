			<p>When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know 
			where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, 
			or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away 
			in an alm ost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the
			multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.</p>

			you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere.
			You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.</p>
