		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter along the 
		Sword Coast or in the North have one thing in common: they live out their lives without ever traveling more than a 
		few miles from where they were born. </p>
		<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">You aren't one of those folk.</p>
		<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk
		in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your 
		homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of Faerun for 
		your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share.</p>	
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land's ways to be 
		strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new 
		wonders that you've never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for good or ill, to 
		those around you almost anywhere you go.</p>
