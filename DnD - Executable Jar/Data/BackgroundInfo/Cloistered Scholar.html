		<p style="margin-bottom:0em">As a child, you were inquisitive when your playmates were possessive or raucous. In 
		your formative years, you found your way to one of Faerum's great institutes of learning, where you were 
		apprenticed and taught that knowledge is a more valuable treasure than gold or gems. Now you are ready to leave 
		your home-not to abandon it, but to quest for new lore to add to its storehouse of knowledge. </p>
		<p style="margin:0em; text-indent:15px">The most well known of Faerun's fonts of knowledge is Candlekeep. The 
		great library is always in need of workers and attendants, some of whom rise through the ranks to assume roles of 
		greater responsibility and prominence. You might be one of Candlekeep's own, dedicated to the curatorship of what 
		is likely the most complete body of lore and history in all the world.</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-indent:15px">Perhaps instead you were taken in by the scholars of the Vault of the Sages 
		or the Map House in Silverymoon, and now you have struck out to increase your knowledge and to make yourself 
		available to help those in other places who seek your expertise. You might be one of the few who aid Herald's 
		Holdfast, helping to catalogue and maintain records of the information that arrives daily from across Faerun.</p>
