		You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate, a ruthless cutthroat who taught
		you how to survive in a world of sharks and savages. You've indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent more 
		than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you've garnered a 
		somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town.<br><br>
