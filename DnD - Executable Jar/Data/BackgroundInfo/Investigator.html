		Rather than watch or patrol members are a community's investigators, who are responsible for solving crimes after 
		the fact. Though such folk are seldom found in rural areas, nearly every settlement of decent size has at least one
		or two watch members who have the skill to investigate crime scenes and track down criminals.<br><br>

			locations rather than the latter.</p>
