		What many tortle consider a simple life, others might call a life of adventure. Tortles are born near sandy 
		coastlines, but as soon as they're able to walk on two legs, they become nomad survivalists eager to explore 
		the wilderness, experience its many wonders, put their skills to the test, and make new acquaintances.<br><br>

			<p>Strength score +2<br>
			Wisdom score +1<br></p>

		<button class="accordion">Age</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Young tortles crawl for a few weeks after birth before learning to walk on two legs. They reach adulthood 
			by the age of 15 and live an average of 50 years.</p>
	    </div>
		
		<button class="accordion">Alignment</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Tortles tend to lead orderly, ritualistic lives. They develop customs and routines, becoming more set 
			in their ways as they age. Most are lawful good. A few can be selfish and greddy, tending more toward evil, 
			but it's unusual for a tortle to shuck off order in favor of chaos.</p>
	    </div>
		
		<button class="accordion">Size</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Tortle adults stand 5 to 6 feet tall and average 450 pounds. Their shells account for roughly one-third 
			of their weight. Your size is Medium.</p>
		</div>
		
		<button class="accordion">Speed</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
	    </div>

		<button class="accordion">Claws</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you 
			deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for 
			an unarmed strike.</p>
	    </div>
		
		<button class="accordion">Hold Breath</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time. Tortles aren't natural swimmers, but they can remain 
			underwater for some time before needing to come up for air.</p>
	    </div>
		
		<button class="accordion">Natural Armor</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample 
			protection, however; it gibes you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain 
			no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.</p>
	    </div>
		
		<button class="accordion">Shell Defense</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have 
			advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 
			and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only 
			action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.</p>
	    </div>
		
		<button class="accordion">Survival Instinct</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>You gain proficiency in the Survival skill. Tortles have finely honed survival instincts.</p>

		<button class="accordion">Languages</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>You can speak, read, and write Aquan and Common.</p>
