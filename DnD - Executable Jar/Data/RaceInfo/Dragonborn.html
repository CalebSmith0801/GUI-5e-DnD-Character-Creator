		Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through 
		a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. 
		Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally 
		hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons 
		and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the 
		ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, 
		with no clear calling in life.<br><br>

			<p>You can use your action to exhale desctructive energy determined by your Draconic Ancestry.</p>

			The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. 
			A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. 
			The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.</p>
