		Goblins are a race of small and numerous goblinoids common throughout Toril, often living in underground caverns 
		near the surface known as lairs. The race is often, though not always, dominated by other goblinoids, most commonly
		hobgoblins. Goblins may have, in fact, been initially created by this related race to serve as scouts and
		infiltrators.<br><br>
