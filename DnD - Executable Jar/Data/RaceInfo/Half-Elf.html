		Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities 
		of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined 
		senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their 
		emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. 
		Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while 
		their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of
		solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.<br><br>

			<button class="accordion" style="font-size:14px; padding: 5px">Dancing Lights</button>
			<div class="panel" id="sub">
				<p><b>Dancing Lights: (Evocation Cantrip)</b><br>
				<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
				<b>Range:</b> 120 feet<br>
				<b>Components:</b> V, S, M</p>
				<ul>
					<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
					<li>S - You must have at least one free hand.</li>
					<li>M - You must have a bit of phosporous or wychwood.</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="margin-bottom:0em";><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>
				<b>Description:</b> You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, 
				lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into 
				one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 
				10-foot radius.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">As a bonus action on your turn, you can move 
				the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created 
				by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.</p>

				<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
				<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
				<b>Components:</b> V - You must be able to speak.<br>
				<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 Minute<br>
				<b>Description:</b> Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light 
				(your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity
				saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top:0em;">Any attack roll against an affected creature
				or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from 
				being invisible.</p>

			<button class="accordion" style="font-size:14px; padding: 5px">Darkness</button>

				<p><b>Darkness: (2nd-Level Evocation)</b><br>
				<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
				<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
				<b>Components:</b> V, M</p>
				<ul>
					<li>V - You must be able to speak.</li>
					<li>M - You must have bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal.</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="margin-bottom:0em";><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>
				<b>Description:</b> Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere
				for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness,
				and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top:0em;">If the point you choose is on an object you 
				are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. 
				Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 15px; 0em; margin-top:0em;">If any of this spell's area overlaps with an 
				area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</p>
