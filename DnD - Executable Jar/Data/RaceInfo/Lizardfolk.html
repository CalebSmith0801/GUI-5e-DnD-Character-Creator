		Only a fool looks at the lizardfolk and sees nothing more than scaly humanoids. Their physical shape 
		notwithstanding, lizardfolk have more in common with iguanas or dragons than they do with humans, dwarves, or elves. 
		Lizardfolk possess an alien and inscrutable mindset, their desires and thoughts driven by a different set of 
		basic principles than those of warm-blooded creatures. Their dismal swamp homes might lie hundreds of miles 
		from the nearest human settlement, but the gap between their way of thinking and that of the smooth-skins 
		is far greater. Despite their alien outlook, some lizardfolk make an effort to understand and, in their own manner,
		befriend people of other races. Such lizardfolk make faithful and skilled allies.<br><br>
