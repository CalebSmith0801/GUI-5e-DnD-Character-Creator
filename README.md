# GUI 5e DnD Character Creator
A GUI DnD character creation/manager program written in Java (specifically JavaFX) that removes the need to constantly be flipping through the DnD books. Includes support for multiple characters, an auto level up feature, and multicasting.

*So far the program will ONLY let you choose your race/subrace, and let you choose between traits if your chosen race gives you that option.
