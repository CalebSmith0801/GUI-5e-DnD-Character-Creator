When Calculating AC
	LizardFolk
		When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine 			your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your 			natural armor.
	Tortle
		Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gibes you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect 			this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus 			as normal.
Tortle
	no benefit from armor but can use shield
Health
	-exhaustion level 4 hit point maximum halved (give way to temporarily reduce max health)
